Q: What are the main differences between external, internal, and inline CSS?
A: External CSS uses a linked .css document to style elements from an external file. Internal CSS uses CSS-specific tags like <style></style> to bring CSS right into the HTML file. Inline CSS is when you add style directly to HTML elements by using the style= attribute, as in 
    <div style="colo: white;></div>

Q: What is the syntax for class and ID selectors?
A: .class { } #id { }

Q: How would you apply a single rule to two different selectors?
A: Group them in a comma-ordered list. Such as:

.class1,
.class2 { 
    property="value";
}

Q: Given an element that has an id of title and a class of primary, how would you use both attributes for a single rule?
A: #title.primary {
    property="value";
}

Q: What does the descendant combinator do?
A: Selects elements that are in a parent/child relationship, also known as 'nested.'

Q: Between a rule that uses one class selector and a rule that uses three type selectors, which rule has the higher specificity?
A: The one with three.
